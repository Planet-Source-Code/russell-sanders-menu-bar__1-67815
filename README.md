'Welcome to The new and improved Menu Control.

I said in the last update that it would be the last but I have fixed a few things that just had to be published. After all the time I put in to the code I left out something as simple as, changing the caption on the fly, out. So I fixed that and also got the tool tips working. a few other small things.

' In the past two months I have put close to 300 hours in this control. I thank you all for looking

'	at it and welcome any comment good or bad.

' This works well for small apps.
